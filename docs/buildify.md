### Requirements
- Create a mining app for Teos Egypt
- Implement user authentication system
- Create a dashboard for miners to track their mining activities
- Implement equipment management system
- Create a reporting system for mining operations
- Implement inventory management for mining resources
- Create a maintenance scheduling system for equipment
- Implement a notification system for alerts and updates
- Create a responsive UI that works on desktop and mobile devices

### Designs
The application will be built using React with TypeScript, utilizing the following architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, React Router for navigation, and Tailwind CSS for styling
2. **State Management**: React Query for server state and React Context for application state
3. **UI Components**: Shadcn UI components for consistent design
4. **Authentication**: Supabase for user authentication and management
5. **Database**: Supabase for storing mining data, equipment information, and user data
6. **Deployment**: Vite for building and serving the application

The application will have the following main sections:
- Authentication (Login/Register)
- Dashboard (Overview of mining operations)
- Equipment Management
- Inventory Management
- Maintenance Scheduling
- Reports
- User Profile
- Admin Panel (for administrators)
